This repository contains the source code (modules and scripts) for 2 main algorithms adopted in the paper:

S. Dinh-Van, T. M. Hoang, R. Trestian and H. X. Nguyen, "Unsupervised Deep Learning-based Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Broadcasting Communications in Industrial IoTs," in IEEE Internet of Things Journal, doi: 10.1109/JIOT.2022.3169276.

Two algorithms are developed:

- Refer to module/ml_model.py for Unsupervised DNN algorithm
- Refer to module/riemannian.py for Riemannian Conjugate Gradient

Do not forget to install the entire package before use.
